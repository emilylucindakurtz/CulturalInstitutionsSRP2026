### Finding Institutions

"Cultural instition" being such a broad term --> countless number of different approaches for choosing 
what types of structures might fall under that category, even if our lens is centered on 
political economy.

Collecting data on industrial businesses (factories/powerplants/corporations) sounds interesting
- potential data sources:
  - https://gis-fema.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/b063316fac7345dba4bae96eaa813b2f/about
  - 

Additionally, I was curious about exploring more about the following types of institutions:
- libraries
  - https://librarytechnology.org/libraries/uspublic/
      - scraping by state for data extraction
- perforance centers (e.g. concert/symphony halls, or sport ML/college sport venues/arenas/stadiums)
  - https://stadiumandarenavisits.com/map/
     -  availible KML of ~1300 US sport venues --> can convert to raw location info

### Data search

#### Industrial Insitiutions
Powerplants:
  - https://gis-fema.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/b063316fac7345dba4bae96eaa813b2f/about

#### Libraries
- https://librarytechnology.org/libraries/uspublic/
  - Super comprehensive website conatining name/addresses of all (~16,000) public libraries in the US
  - Terms of Service could cause useage conflicts --> "Extracting data through automated scripts is prohibited.
    Those interested in access to the underlying data sets can contact Marshall Breeding to discuss available options.
    Library Technology Guides encourages use of the site for personal and academic research."
    - Checked in with Emily about contacting them, so we'll see what happens.

#### Sport Venues

#### concert/symphony halls
- https://en.concerts-metal.com/places_us.html
  - contains data on ~800 music venues in the US. Mainly only those which host Metal/Hardrock/Punk bands.
    Also, venue size ranges from large concert halls to small breweries/ bars that could have more isolated, local, impacts.
    - Looks like it might be challanging to efficiently scrape all helpful information, appears to have api.
- https://www.operabase.com/organisations/venue/united-states/en?page=1
  - large comprehensive database containing information on concert venues in the US, no genre focus like above
  - has API, also looks like scraping would not be challenging since it's just a multi-page list
  - For location information: only contains city address, nothing more specific. Additionally, no lat/long information. Would likely have to pull
    that info from supplemental location dataset.
